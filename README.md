# Advent of Code â€“ Kotlin solutions

Developed in IntelliJ IDEA (run configurations included). Each day is in its own object (e.g. `Day01`).

Resource files for your specific datasets go in `src/resources/net/mtcoster/advent/dataYY` (where `YY` is the last two digits of the year):
 - Inputs are named `inputDD.txt` (where `DD` is the day, zero padded).
 - Known outputs are named `solutionDDX.txt` (where `DD` is as before, and `X` is either `a` or `b`).

When present, known outputs are compared with the computed outputs to ensure they haven't changed.
